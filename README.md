# Cortex Parcellation using Meshes

Master's thesis at ai-med. The project deals with an approach for cortex parcellation based on pixel2mesh/voxel2mesh.

The long-living branches are structured as follows:

- master: most tested, very stable  
- run: usually ready to run but maybe not tested extensively
- dev: development in progress, probably not runnable
